# AppleScript_finderLib
#### AppleScript Scripting Library for Common Finder Functions

This library is a collection of common Finder-centric AppleScript subroutines. Many are my own. Many come courtesy of [http://applescript.bratis-lover.net](http://applescript.bratis-lover.net "Brati's Lover"). Some of these subroutines (mostly my contributions) are a bit verbose as I wrote them awhile ago before I delved into programming in things such as PHP, Ruby, and Perl. So if portions feel like "three lefts make a right", know that syntactic elegance was not yet in my vocabulary.
